Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Install required Python libraries by running:
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
Download the Dataset:
Download the dataset file WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv.
Code Setup:
Place the dataset file (WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv) in the same directory as the Python script.
Copy the provided code into a Python script file (e.g., customer_churn_analysis.py) using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).
Run the Script:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the Python script and dataset file are located.
Run the Python script using the following command:
python customer_churn_analysis.py
Interpret the Results:
The script will generate various visualizations and output the results of different machine learning models used for predicting customer churn.
Check the directory for saved images containing visualizations (e.g., churnGraphs folder).
Review the printed results in the terminal or command prompt.
Optional Modifications:
You can modify the code to experiment with different preprocessing techniques, machine learning algorithms, or evaluation metrics.
Customize the code to suit your specific requirements or dataset characteristics.
